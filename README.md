# aiDEr-Local for [aider v0.54.0](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider/releases/tag/v0.54.0)
- Its a fork, the main is, [here](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider) or [here](https://aider.chat/).
- Fork Status: Alpha - Under Development.

### DEVELOPMENT:
- Here is the typical output from using a `DeepSeek v2 Lite Q8 GGUF` based model, and its coming up with errors, is that the, model or model card or aider or ollama, im lost. I get the feeling DeepSeek v2 should be larger though, cant rule it out being a 16B model. Ensure modelcard is correct from some official source, and reinstall model to ollama, and test....
```
The LLM did not conform to the edit format.

No filename provided before ``` in file listing
Only 3 reflections allowed, stopping.
```
1. LM Studio is not working because the OpenAI API requires a key to use currently, so, streamlining + conversion of OpenAI to LMStudio or addition of a `--lmstudio` argument for new code, as well as conversion. Possibly Launch command isnt right...
```
Model gpt-4o-2024-08-06: Environment variables status:
- OPENAI_API_KEY: âœ— Not set
If you just set these environment variables using `setx` you may need to restart your terminal or command prompt for the
changes to take effect.
For more info, see: https://aider.chat/docs/llms/warnings.html
```
3. When LM Studio is fixed, elevate status to beta.
4. Complete download of model (see NOTATIONS section) - In the mean time we are testing with "deepseek-v2-lite-instruct" in Q8 GGUF. 
5. running with file(s) needs testing/investigating.
4. Testing Running aider - Is the install complete? Are there any further issues.
4. Edit main branch files, after batches are finished...
- Streamlining of identifiaction to, local models only, with exception of, huggingface (see below intelligent use of models) and and adapt openai to LM Studio.
- Local models will be added to identify correctly the models, that I will list, that will be based upon, what is the best performing models, for a limitation of 64GB, this will mainly include ensuring no issues with, llama v3.1 Meta unfiltered and deep-seek v2 lite, in gguf.
- for Intelligent use of Huggingface API to the  `https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct` or `https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct`, after 3 errors in a row, as large model will likely sort it out, then revert back to local model after, and reset counter, however if it does not solve the same issue in one, then ask user if it should, additionally interact with huggingface using the larger model or allow the user to take a look at the files then re-test (requring re-prompt) or whatever would normally happen vanilla after 3 errors if it were not having the code to interact with larger models on huggingface. I also found out that deepseek provide 500,000,000 free tokens, this is clearly an idea.

### DESCRIPTION:
- The aiDEr-Local project includes a set of batch scripts designed to facilitate the setup and execution of the aiDEr application in a local environment. The aiDEr-Local.Bat script serves as a user-friendly launcher, providing options to run the application with various configurations, including different models and file inputs. It ensures that settings are preserved across sessions through a persistence mechanism, enabling consistent operation without requiring reconfiguration. The accompanying Install-Setup.Bat script automates the environment setup, detecting the necessary Python installation, installing dependencies, and ensuring that the environment is properly configured. Together, these scripts provide a streamlined and reliable workflow for managing and running the aiDEr application locally.

### FEATURES:
- Enforces administrator privileges to ensure proper execution and environment control.
- Provides an interactive menu for selecting different modes to run the aiDEr application.
- Supports model management, allowing users to select, delete, and configure models for Ollama.
- Handles configuration persistence through a persistence.txt file to save and load settings across sessions.
- Detects and configures the Python environment, including automatic installation of required packages.
- Allows for the execution of aiDEr with or without file inputs, adapting to various use cases.
- Includes error handling and user prompts for guidance during setup and execution.
- Verifies and installs essential Python packages, such as setuptools and wheel, to ensure a stable environment.

Model DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct installed successfully.

## REQUIREMENTS:
- Windows v7-v11?? - version 10 is the, programming and testing, platform, and thats non-WSL.
- Python v3.9-3.12 - Now working with whatever version of Python is specified by the user during setup.

### USAGE:
1. Copy aider from the zip to a suitable directory, ie `D:\Programs\aider-0.5x.x`.
2. The files are dropped into relevantly `D:\Programs\aider-0.5x.x` or whatever folder. 
3. Run the batch `Install-Setup.Bat`, it will for setup and install of requirements, this includes, `setup-tools` and `requirements.txt`.
4. Ensure model is loaded in LM Studio, or otherwise that you have installed the model in Ollama (see folder .\modelfiles). 
5. Run The batch `aiDEr-Offline.Bat`, to, configure models/threads, and launch aider with, LM Studio or Ollama, with options to include files.

## NOTATION:
- When selecting model, you would copy and paste, for example `DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct:latest`, not `DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct`.
- As you can tell from the threads settings for ollama, its currently designed for CPU users, but if you are on GPU, then you will want to set it to `0` for `auto`, where for Ollama to manager it for you, or set it to how many shader threads you have. At least I think thats how it works. I have a AMD RX 470, but if you can donate on kofi, maybe I will have a, AMD RX 7600 or GeForce RTX 4060, a little sooner, and these things can be known.
- Did notice that the Deepseek v2 GGUF would not load at a context higher than 8192 in LM Studio, so, these are the settings for Ollama, for now in the relating modelfile installer.
- Whats the best model for aider?? Apparently Deepseek Coder Light Instruct in 16b is as good as llama 3 instruct 70b, but they are the top dogs (Guessing [Meta-Llama-3.1-Chat-Uncensored-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/Meta-Llama-3.1-Chat-Uncensored-GGUF) in Q5 is the best one for 64GB System Ram. The meta rounds off its abilities, and uncensored supposedly more intelligent, and its 3.1 not 3.0)...

- For Ollama, ensure model is installed correctly, see `.\modelfiles\*` for a better idea.
